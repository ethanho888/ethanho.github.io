              I'm a fourth year studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> with a minor in Education. I recently finished up my software engineering internship at Uber on their Core Infrastructure Team. Last summer I was a SWE intern at Datadog on their Dashboards team as a part of <a href="https://hackny.org/2019/06/announcing-the-class-of-2019-hackny-fellows/">hackNY</a>.</p>
            <p>
              On campus I'm a software developer for <a href="https://www.calblueprint.org/">Blueprint</a>, a mentor for <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/programs/first-generation-mentor-program/">First-Generation Engineering students</a>, and part of the teaching staff for <a href="http://www.ds100.org/">Data 100</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m the lookout for new grad SWE and PM opportunities for spring 2021 graduates. Here is my <a target="_blank" href="assets/AliceYeZhao2021">resume</a> and you can reach me at alicezhao@berkeley.edu if you want to link up!

              <h3 style="padding-top: 32px">Quick plug for my Medium</h3>
              <p>I recently started writing more on <a href="https://medium.com/@aliceyezhao">Medium</a>. Journalism was a hobby of mine in high school but unfortunately I lost touch with writing in the midst of my CS major. I've trying to output stories that aren't necessarily related to tech, but that focus more on my narrative. Follow me for some amusing reads!</p>

              <h3 style="padding-top: 32px">What I want to do when I "grow up"</h3>
              <p>So far I am enjoying software development and I want to keep improving myself as an engineer. I am on my second SWE internship and I find it exciting to build things and learn new technologies that keep the world running. I have also enjoyed being a project leader for a team of developers and designers, so I’m also looking into product management. Through that experience, I have found some of my strengths to be prioritization, people management, and inclusivity.</p>

              <p>Beyond tech, I want to be a high school teacher. Our high school years are very formative and I remember the teachers that had both positive and negative impacts on me. I think it is a huge responsibility to educate today’s youth, which is why I don’t think I would be prepared for it straight out of undergrad. As I develop my career in tech, I will continue to think critically about the new generation that is being born.</p>

              <h3 style="padding-top: 32px">For those struggling in CS</h3>
              <p>Getting into Berkeley Engineering has been a highlight of my life, what I didn’t know was that it was going to be my only win for a while. When I walked into my first EECS course I felt way out of my league — the large class sizes made me feel isolated and I felt like I was being left behind by my peers. The glorification of my major made me feel inadequate in comparison and I began to question why I was EECS at all. </p>

              <p>“I regret to inform you” is the phrase I’ve read the most during my college career. At first it hurt a lot. I have a spreadsheet with a hundred rows that details every internship and organization I have applied for. When rejection is coupled with exhaustion, it hurts. It was hard to watch my friends get into student organizations and find new communities from the sidelines. When rejection is coupled with gate-keeping, it hurts more. I’ve also been on the other side, trying to decide someone’s worth by some essays and a resume. When rejection is coupled with guilt, it can hurt too.</p>

              <p>However what I have taken away from years of rejection as a Berkeley engineer is that there are other ways of showing how you can add value. Personal relationships are valued a lot more than I realized. I was under the impression that engineering roles were purely about technical skill, but like any other job, it is crucial to be friendly and sociable. You would be surprised how much you can learn when you're not afraid of reaching out.</p> 

              <p>Things will work out if you keep your chin up. It's ok to feel like the worst engineer in the room, as long as you know how to escape that mindset. You are your own biggest advocate. Not even the most accomplished engineer can completely overcome rejection, it’s NP-hard.</p>

              <p>Thank you for taking the time to read through my website! If there is anything I can help you with, please don't hesitate to shoot me an email at alicezhao@berkeley.edu. Best of luck and I am rooting for you! </p><br/><br/><br/>
